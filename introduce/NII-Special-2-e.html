This step is mainly handled using language processing techniques. "Language processing" here refers to converting questions, provided in the form of text, to expressions which the computer can understand. Broadly speaking, this part of the process is identical for both mathematics and physics questions. However, from that point on, the approaches diverge.</span></span>

For different types of formulas, different reasoning algorithms (solvers) are used. The derivation process of the formula thus bridges the gap between the logical expressions of the question and the logical expressions necessary to calculate its solution. In the case of physics questions, the problem is also understood using language processing, but the next step is to use "physics simulators". They simulate the physical process described in the problem, and the solution is determined by looking at the results of the simulation. This step thus differs from the mathematics problem-solving approach. NII's Hikaru Yokono, who is involved in the physics question area of the project, explains,&nbsp;</span>

Computers, on the other hand, use a physics simulator to actually replicate the situation described in the problem, measure the results, and select the choice which is closest to the simulation results."&nbsp;</span>

The basic solution methods and framework for the second-stage exam are the same as for the center test.

For example, even if a formula is valid, it will require a tremendous amount of calculation when there are many variables in it. There are, however, almost no entrance exam problems which could not be solved by a solver if we follow the problem solving approach envisioned by the author of the question. The key to solving exam problems within the allotted time is hence how we derive the formula."</span>

However, we don't take the approach of investigating the process humans use in actually solving these problems. Instead, we consider how to create a system which would achieve high scores, and if it produces positive results, then it makes sense to compare that approach to human thought processes," says Matsuzaki.</span>

There are still challenges to surmount." Center test physics questions tend to concentrate on four areas: dynamics, electromagnetics, waves, and thermodynamics. Existing physics simulations can be used for questions about dynamics and electricity. On the other hand, wave and thermodynamics simulations are complex, yet high school physics level questions do not demand an extremely high level of accuracy. So we need to consider an approach that is not simulation-based.</span>

The project has not yet begun tackling this question type. The key to solving these problems will be to combine the prediction by physics simulators together with other infrastructure technologies.</span>

Engineers would be far more likely to use the solvers if the project made it possible to feed the solvers a question and have them automatically provide an answer," said Anai, discussing his hopes for the project.&nbsp;</span>

From the perspective of natural language processing, it clearly defines the goal of language analysis in the form of formal representations. From the perspective of solver algorithms, it would systematize the know-how necessary to solve problems.</span>

The challenge will give us insights on the new relationships between humans and computers."</span>

However, a modern robot wouldn't know that the laws of physics would make the object fall. Advances in AI would make it possible for computers to understand real-world situations, use physical simulations to model changing situations governed by physical laws, and predict future states."</span>
