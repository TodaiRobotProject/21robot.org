We talked with Yasuhiro Matsumura, who passed the Tokyo University entrance exam last year, and Hiroyoshi Komatsu, a high school student who is participating in the Todai Robot Project, about what interests them in the project, and their hopes for its future, from their respective perspectives as an impartial observer and someone directly involved in the project.<br />

A lot of people are interested in the project, not just students majoring in natural language processing or mathematics. Today, I'd like to get the opinions of the younger generation on this project. How did you two first hear about the Todai Robot Project?&nbsp;

I read an interview with you, Professor Arai, in a mathematics journal in 2011, and I found your approach of putting science and mathematics questions into words to be very close to my own interests. It made a big impression. Then this spring, when I interviewed you for the University of Tokyo Newspaper, I heard more about the project, and realized how interesting it was.&nbsp;

I'm in 11th grade now, but I started programming when I was in 7th grade. In 9th grade I grew interested in artificial intelligence research and began working on natural language processing, so I wanted to work on the Todai Robot Project, if possible. Actually, after about a month of studying natural language processing, I wanted to join the Association for Natural Language Processing, but my parents objected (laughs). But I kept studying on my own, joining the next year, which led up to my involvement in Todai Robot Project.

I think that Todai Robot Project's ability to reach its objectives on the 2016 National Center Test for University Admissions will vary depending on the subject. It's hard to come up with approaches for solving questions on sections like the Japanese section.

During the early 20th century, when Turing developed the logic on which computers are based, this question became divorced from its philosophical underpinning, and a framework was created for considering it as an engineering problem. Artificial intelligence research made many advances, but in the 1980s began faltering. At the time, computing power was still low, there was little data, and the environment itself was not yet robust. The issue of artificial intelligence was broken down into smaller segments, but I think every 30 years these need to brought back together, and used to accomplish whatever is possible with the technologies of the time, leading into the next age of AI research. In this project, I hope to integrate and consider these technologies, and identify what can and cannot be accomplished. What cannot be accomplished can be set aside for 30 years down the line.

Even for problems which are extremely easy for people, we still don't understand the thought processes involved. I'm also studying neuroscience and cognitive science, and I hope that by working to create artificial intelligence, I can also shine some light on those fields. Even if I fail, I can use what I have learned to keep moving forward.

I call the Todai Robot Project a "risk hedge project". When trying to provide machines with artificial intelligence that corresponds to the learning abilities of humans, one can only improve accuracy in logarithmic relation to the amount of data, so big data is required for accuracy improvements. However, it's difficult for academic institutions inside Japan to collect the big data they need. That's why there needs to be research into how to improve accuracy using small data. Even if we collect all the entrance exam data for the last twenty years, it only constitutes a small amount of data. The approach of making accurate inferences based on small data goes against the prevailing worldwide research current, but it's extremely important. And cool. I hope that young people get to experience that.
